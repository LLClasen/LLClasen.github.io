# Portfolio Projects
### Weather API Program
This application interacts with a webservice in order to obtain data. The program prompts the user for their city or zip code and requests weather forecast data from openweathermap.org. The program displays the weather information in a readable format to the user.

# Final Project 1/3
## Detecting Credit Card Fraud

### What was used:

- Python Programming Language
- Machine-Learning Algorithms

This is a compilation of materials for my first project in the course DSC 680 (Applied Data Science) at Bellevue University. This project aims to build a machine learning model that has the capability to predict, with great accuracy, when a credit card transaction presents as being fraudulent. Beginning with exploratory data analysis, I use machine learning algorithms to understand and work through these data. By exploring the data set and understanding trends, I build and train a model to predict which transactions are fraudulent, ultimately aiming to test and select the most accurate model for this set of data.
